# Phi Mui SQL Project 

## Background 
As a member of a certain organization, you are required to earn a certain number of points and hours each semester. 
Specifically, you must earn 8 cap points, 8 quat points, 8 phi mu points, and 6 community service hours per semester. 
You are required to continue earning these points until your senior year, when you are given "senior experience" as a recognition of your previous efforts. 
However, even while enjoying senior experience, you must still earn at least one point or hour in each category each semester

## Implementation 
I have created a login page, a sign-up page, and an hours-added page for a web application using the Java programming language and the Java Swing library. These pages are connected to a database using MySQL for storing and accessing user data. The login and sign-up pages feature graphical user interface (GUI) elements such as text fields, buttons, and labels, which are implemented using the Java Swing library. The hours-added page allows users to enter and submit data using these GUI elements, and the submitted data is stored in the MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connectivity

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the Java classes in this project, you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the JDK from the Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## Compiling the Java source files
Run the javac command followed by the names of the Java source files. For example </br>
### *javac LogIn.java SignUpForm.java HoursForm.java*

## Running the compiled Java bytecode
To run the compiled Java bytecode, use the java command followed by the name of the class that contains the main method. For example: <br />
