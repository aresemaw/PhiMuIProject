# PhiMuIProject 

## Background 
As a member of a certain organization, you are required to earn a certain number of points and hours each semester. 
Specifically, you must earn 8 cap points, 8 quat points, 8 phi mu points, and 6 community service hours per semester. 
You are required to continue earning these points until your senior year, when you are given "senior experience" as a recognition of your previous efforts. 
However, even while enjoying senior experience, you must still earn at least one point or hour in each category each semester

## Implenmentation 
I have created a login page, a sign-up page, and an hours-added page for a web application using the Java programming language and the Java Swing library. These pages are connected to a database using MySQL for storing and accessing user data. The login and sign-up pages feature graphical user interface (GUI) elements such as text fields, buttons, and labels, which are implemented using the Java Swing library. The hours-added page allows users to enter and submit data using these GUI elements, and the submitted data is stored in the MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connectivity
