# PhiMuIProject 

## Background 
As a member of a certain organization, you are required to earn a certain number of points and hours each semester. 
Specifically, you must earn 8 cap points, 8 quat points, 8 phi mu points, and 6 community service hours per semester. 
You are required to continue earning these points until your senior year, when you are given "senior experience" as a recognition of your previous efforts. 
However, even while enjoying senior experience, you must still earn at least one point or hour in each category each semester
